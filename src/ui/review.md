Response:
Did you know that inadequate testing is responsible for about 5 to 10 defects being found in about 1000 lines of coding (Das, 2018)?  Despite when things go according to design, applied science is rarely cheap and undoubtedly complex. The above statistic shows that when things get disastrous, the slightest error can cost enormous amounts of money, and in some cases, human fatalities. Simultaneously, when things do go according to plan, the results can be marvelous for societal needs.  Data representation in computing, which refers to how data is stored, processed, and transmitted, is vital to the project (Sigfried, 2021).  Data refers to the symbols that represent people, events, things, and ideas.  The 0s and 1s used to describe digital data are referred to as binary digits.  Data representation plays a vital role in both success and failure, as seen in the following examples:

When foam struck Columbia's Space Shuttle Challenger wing during launch on January 28, 1986, a group of engineers became very worried. During the mission, this group worked to figure out whether the shuttle had been damaged. Despite the engineers' growing concerns, shuttle program managers modulated the threat of foam. In addition, board members disagreed on who was to blame for such a crucial error.  Physicist Dr. James Hallock conducted a thought experiment to determine how much force would violate the specs for the wing panel strength (Mcdonald, 2012). He used a number 2 pencil to communicate his shocking revelation. The wing has to withstand something similar to a pencil dropping for a height of six inches. We now know more--that the shuttle wing was more robust than that.  Hallock's discovery revealed that NASA had failed to consider the shuttle's design requirements when assessing the form strike on Columbia.  This experiment was reminiscent of Dr. Richard Feynman's demonstration during the Challenger investigation in 1986. Feynman’s analysis showed that O-rings get hard when exposed to cold temperatures. O-rings, which keep fluid or air in or out of a defined space on the aircraft, were exposed to freezing temperatures by launching the spacecraft when the temperature was below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately, this experiment only occurred after the fact and was not known before takeoff.  If NASA had ensured the data before launch, then this catastrophe may have been avoided.  

Gordon Moore relied more on data representation.  As a result, Moore’s Law, a technological law, was established.  Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, recognized the marvel of the number of integrated circuits on a chip doubles every two years.  His intuition eventually progressed into what’s now known as Moore’s Law.  In other words, the price for the same computing power will be cut in half every two years.  Moore’s Law has held accurate for over forty years.   One possibility is that Moore's Law will soon hit warp speed.  This speed is thanks to specific innovations and breakthroughs at polynomial speeds, mostly in part to the quickly imminent reality of quantum computing.

While some may argue that this reality may not occur for more than a decade, one thing is clear - the ramifications of quantum will be groundbreaking.  Going beyond any predictive models and research provided by today’s computer scientists, quantum's power is beyond any technology we have today.  Though the applications for quantum computing will most definitely be incomplete at first, there are also clear inevitabilities of how its power can be applied - fields such as AI, genetic research, engineering, and economics (Xie, 2018).  These challenges are known as optimization problems (Xie, 2018).  Due to all of the optimization problems, a perilous essential of cybersecurity: encryption.

Encryption is the process of encoding information, so only those authorized to access it are able.  Cybersecurity researchers are concerned that the advanced algorithms could easily break through most modern coding.  IBM's general manager for client and solutions development in the Federal and Public market said, “For all the dramatic advances offered by quantum computing, it could create a huge threat to the security of our data” (Daly, 2021).  He also said, “It offers the powerful potential to break certain types of cryptography that safeguards many critical communications” (Daly, 2021).  The journey to the future for quantum cybersecurity will be arduous.  However, as tricky as the invention of quantum computer hardware is, as history has shown, the proper data representation models will evolve the technological progress from today into the future.
